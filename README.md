# CV-Analyzer
The CV Analyzer is a web application built using Flask that enables users to upload multiple CVs in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats and automatically extract key details such as full name, email address, and phone number. The application uses regular expressions to parse the content and identify relevant information from each file. It features a clean, responsive frontend and provides users with the option to download the extracted data in a consolidated CSV format. This tool is especially useful for recruiters or HR teams looking to streamline the initial screening process by quickly gathering essential candidate information from resumes.
